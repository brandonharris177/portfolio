          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>In 2018 I graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelors in Economics and realized "I have no hard skills". Several months of job searching led me to the conclusion that without the ability to make an immediate impact wherever I worked my degree was no more useful to employers than the paper it was printed on. During this time, I noticed a common thread; everyone was looking for someone who could code, talk to computers, design, manipulate and analyse data. This realization that the internet is here to stay led me to Lambda School where I got my first real into to code and learned the skills to further a career in Web Development.</p>

          <p>I have experience working in a variety of fields before Web Development including Warehouse Manager, Turf and Solar Installation as well as a Contract Handyman. I love seeing the results of a well built project or peice of code come together. In many ways the principles are the same for construction and coding: have patience, don't be afraid to learn, and find satisfaction in the journey and the product. <br/>
          When I'm not coding I enjoy riding my motorcyle, throwing around the football, a game of Magic: The Gathering, or a good book, preferably a Clancy novel or books about life sciences. <br/> To talk about my work or about how I can help you feel free to shoot me an email at brandonharris177@gmail.com
